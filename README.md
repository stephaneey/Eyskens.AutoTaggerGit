# Eyskens.AutoTaggerGit
An auto-tagging add-in for SharePoint Online

This add-on for SharePoint Online facilitates auto-tagging of Word and PDF documents. It leverages SharePoint taxonomies and
allows a very granular configuration to instruct the tagging on how to match taxonomy terms and document content in order to
avoid noisy associations.

A full demo and technical explanation is available on my blog at http://www.silver-it.com/node/183
