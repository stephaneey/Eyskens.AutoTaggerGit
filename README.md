# Eyskens.AutoTaggerGit
An auto-tagging add-in for SharePoint Online

This add-on for SharePoint Online facilitates auto-tagging of Word and PDF documents. It leverages SharePoint taxonomies and
allows a very granular configuration to instruct the tagging on how to match taxonomy terms and document content in order to
avoid noisy associations.

On top of managed termsets, the Add-In is also capable of Enterprise Keywords recognition and creation. The creation process involves tokenization, lemmatization and named entity recognition. A noise words list can be created and thresholds can be set to maximize efficiency for both recognition and creation processes. 

Several videos demonstrating the Add-In are available on my Youtube Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJhxiAUkEaeg09H3mPjtgTw and a full documentation is available in PDF format on my blog http://www.silver-it.com/sites/default/files/EyskensAutoTagging.pdf
